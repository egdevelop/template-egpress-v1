The launch of Apple Vision Pro has opened a new frontier for designers. Spatial computing isn't just about 3D interfaces—it's about reimagining how humans interact with digital content in physical space.

## What is Spatial Computing?

Spatial computing blends digital and physical worlds, allowing users to interact with virtual objects as if they existed in real space. Unlike traditional screens, spatial interfaces exist all around you.

### Key Concepts

- **Spatial UI** - Interfaces that exist in 3D space
- **Hand tracking** - Natural gesture-based interaction
- **Eye tracking** - Gaze as an input method
- **Passthrough** - Seeing the real world through the device

## Design Considerations

### Depth and Dimension

In spatial design, you're not limited to a flat canvas. Consider:

- How far away should elements be?
- What's the viewing angle?
- How do objects relate to each other in 3D space?

### Ergonomics

Users will be wearing these devices for extended periods. Design for comfort:

- Avoid placing important elements too high or low
- Keep content at comfortable viewing distances
- Consider physical fatigue from arm movements

### Context Awareness

Spatial apps exist in real environments:

- How does your app adapt to different room sizes?
- What happens when users move around?
- How do you handle occlusion with real objects?

## New Interaction Paradigms

### Gaze and Pinch

The primary interaction model for Vision Pro:
1. Look at an element to highlight it
2. Pinch thumb and finger to select

### Spatial Gestures

- Pointing to navigate
- Grabbing to move objects
- Scaling with two hands

## Getting Started

1. Study Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for visionOS
2. Experiment with Unity or RealityKit
3. Prototype in 3D before building
4. Test with real users in real spaces

## The Future

Spatial computing is in its infancy. Designers who embrace this new medium now will shape how humanity interacts with technology for decades to come.
