A landing page has one job: convert visitors into leads or customers. Yet many pages fail because they make these common mistakes.

## 1. Weak Headlines

Your headline is the first thing visitors see. A vague or boring headline loses attention immediately.

**Fix:** Be specific about the benefit. "Save 10 Hours a Week on Reports" beats "Better Reporting Software."

## 2. Too Many Distractions

Navigation menus, multiple CTAs, and unrelated content dilute focus.

**Fix:** Remove navigation and focus on a single conversion goal.

## 3. Slow Load Times

Every second of load time costs conversions. Studies show a 1-second delay reduces conversions by 7%.

**Fix:** Optimize images, minimize code, and use a CDN.

## 4. Unclear Value Proposition

Visitors should immediately understand what you offer and why it matters.

**Fix:** Lead with benefits, not features. Show the transformation you provide.

## 5. Missing Social Proof

People trust other people more than they trust brands.

**Fix:** Include testimonials, reviews, case studies, and trust badges.

## 6. Complicated Forms

Every additional form field reduces conversions. Only ask for what you truly need.

**Fix:** Start with just email. Collect more information later.

## 7. No Mobile Optimization

Over half of web traffic is mobile. A page that's hard to use on mobile loses half its potential.

**Fix:** Design mobile-first and test on real devices.

## Conclusion

Landing page optimization is iterative. Test one change at a time, measure results, and continuously improve. Small changes can lead to significant gains in conversion rates.
